											<h1>Hi, I'm Aaron Kerestes<br />
											</h1>
											<p>Data Analyst with a background in sales, a passion for sustainability, brand stories, and a love for animals</p>
										</header>
										<p>My name is Aaron Kerestes and am a Senior Territory Manager for RJReynolds Tobacco with a passion for data, analytics, animals and sustainability. I was born and raised in Southern California. Upon finishing high school, I had the opportunity to move to Tucson, Arizona to attend the University of Arizona. During my time in school, I developed my passion for data and analytics through analytical courses and projects. After obtaining a degree in Marketing,  I was given a full-time position with Reynolds American and moved to Salt Lake City, Utah in September of 2020. In my free time, I enjoy playing golf, hiking, and attending concerts and music festivals.</p>

												<h3>Dive into the data</h3>
												<p>When approaching any problems in the business, I will always refer to all the data available to me and what can ultimately be uncovered. Being data-driven helps uncover key insights and opportunities for key stakeholders.</p>

											<span class="icon solid fa-phone"></span>
											<div class="content">
												<h3>Empathy and Communication</h3>
												<p>Coming from a sales background, I believe it is important to remain transparent and understanding with whoever I communicate with. Understanding the problems at the deepest level help establish credibility with the stakeholders to help find solutions to whatever the problem may be. </p>

												<h3>Persistence leads to results</h3>
												<p>"Nothing in the world can take the place of persistence". Being persistent, especially working with data, is important because you will run into problems and errors. Staying focused on the goal at-hand drives my efficiency and skills in manipulating and cleaning data, and gets better every day.</p>

												<h3>Passion for finding answers</h3>
												<p>Data can provide many insights into the problem at-hand. Cleaning, analyzing, and providing reccomendations is something that not only provides answers to the question at-hand, but provides a sense of accomplishment. The ability to feel accomplished while supporting key stakeholders is what keeps me coming back to data. </p>
